I am a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University studying high energy phenomenology under 
Dr. Matthew R. Buckley. Please use the top navigation bar to access important information 
such as my list of publications, a description of my research, publicly available code, 
and my résumé. Whatever reason you find yourself here, I hope you find something useful here.

Below I include a summary of my research and general interests.

Research Overview
======
My main interests lie beyond our most successful physical models of fundamental physics: 
(1) the standard model of particle physics, (2) the ΛCDM model of cosmology, and 
(3) general relativity. 
The dark matter is the most promising object of study that goes beyond the above models, as the evidence suggests it has a particle nature and it affects the observable Universe through its gravitational interactions. Though I have an affinity for theory, I believe the most important progress to be made in understanding the dark matter requires increasing our available data and improving our techniques for processing it.

I adopted this opinion during my first Ph.D. project on inferring limits on macroscopic dark matter with *Gaia* wide binaries, where I got to better understand both the existing degeneracy in viable dark matter models that can explain the available data and the power that cutting edge data processing can have in constraining dark matter models. Moving forward with this opinion, I am now analyzing the *Fermi-LAT* dataset to better understand the so-called *Galactic Center Excess*--an inability for our best models to fit the available $\gamma$-ray data around the center of the Galaxy. The shape and energies of the excess is suggestive of a dark matter origin, as we would expect dark matter to concentrate at the centers of galaxies in a spherically symmetric configuration and annihilate into high-energy $\gamma$-rays. However, we also don't have a firm understanding of possible astrophysical $\gamma$-rays in the galactic center. Therefore, the problem is two-fold: learning about the $\gamma$-ray emission at the center while accounting for the high astrophysical uncertainties in the models that we use to explain the data. 


<!-- Currently, I am trying to find a way to better resolve the population of point sources measured by the
Fermi-LAT satellite. This would contribute to the arguments of whether or not the excess of gamma-rays in the 
galactic center are due to the dark matter or a faint population of point sources.  -->

<!-- Goals -->
<!-- ====== -->
<!-- In Progress -->
<!-- I live by three fundamental virtues. -->

<!-- 1. Understanding -->
<!-- 2. Love -->
<!-- 3. Faith -->

<!-- Perhaps partially indoctrinated by my studies of physics, these are the deterministic aspects of my being.
Existing in a chaotic and disinterested environment and having a set of initial conditions 
(properly set, thanks to my beautiful family, friends, and all else), it is primarily these 
virtues that have guided me to this point. All my other virtues have been constructed from these. -->

<!-- Perhaps peculiar, my "life's mission" is already complete: I found a path, and now, I move forward, 
until it is time to build where someone else left off. It would be nice to encounter a final cause, establishing what is
really true and, thus, meaningful. But, that is simply a luxury, a gift. And behind any worthwhile gift is an even better one: 
that which makes you deserving of the gift. In my context, *that* is my *entelechy*.  -->

<!-- By the very nature of my mission, I don't seek an end. Beyond my pursuit for the truth,
I hope to continue on the legacy of my loved ones by helping them live a better life, if not their best. 
I want to meet as many people as I can, as many types of people as I can, to learn and get better guidance
on where to go from here. Hopefully, I can return the favor to everyone some day. -->


<!-- Interests -->
<!-- ====== -->
<!-- In Progress -->
<!-- Outside of my research, I enjoy talking to people and getting to know different perspectives of life. 
I like to spend time learning other things ranging from philosophy to some more on-hands abilities. 
These days, I dedicate my free time to exercising, chatting, listening to podcasts, reading, and committing 
to a hobby. -->
