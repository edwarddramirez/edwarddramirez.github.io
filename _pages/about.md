I am a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University studying high energy phenomenology under Matthew R. Buckley. Please use the top navigation bar to access important information such as my list of publications, a description of my research, publicly available code, and my CV. Below I will include a summary of my research interests, goals, history, and general interests.

Research
======
Currently, my main focus is studying the nature of the dark matter. It provides us with very rich problems that are both beyond the Standard Model and beyond the Î›CDM model. So far, I have set constraints on the abundance of dark matter substructure within our Galaxy using observations of *Gaia* wide binaries (arXiv:2207.02214). At some point in the future, I plan on constraining dark matter using different astrophysical datasets. However, currently, I am working at studying dark matter at microscopic scales by finding ways to constrain "swino" dark matter model ( arXiv:2204.05283) using collider data at the LHC. The model has been proposed to resolve the W-mass anomaly. In the future, I will try to implement machine learning to resolve important problems to study the dark matter. 

History
======
I'm one what one would say is the "physicist in the family". Elaborate.

Goals
------
I live by three virtues.

1. Understanding
2. Love
3. Faith

From this, experience, and chance, I have set a few accessible goals for myself. Elaborate.


General Interests
------
Outside of my research, I enjoy talking to people and getting to know different perspectives of life. I like to spend time learning other things ranging from philosophy to some more on-hands abilities. These days, I dedicate my free time to exercising, chatting, listening to podcasts, reading, and committing to a hobby.
