I am a Ph.D. candidate at Rutgers University working on particle physics problems under Matthew R. Buckley. Please use the top navigation bar to access important information such as my CV, list of publications, recent seminars, etc. Below I will include a summary of my research interests, goals, history, and general interests.

Research
======
Currently, my main focus lies in the dark matter problem, for it may be direct evidence against the Standard Model and it is interesting as a structural component of the Universe. I have constrained dark matter models by constraining the abundance of substructure in the Solar Neighborhood with wide binary star systems. In the future, I plan on constraining dark matter using different astrophysical datasets. However, I also plan on constructing a viable dark matter model and developing machine learning algorithms to constrain such models before the end of Ph.D. program. 

History
======
I'm one what one would say is the "physicist in the family". 

Goals
------
I live by three axioms.

1. Strive for understanding
2. Love and teach to love
3. Let understanding and love be the guide

From this, experience, and chance, I have set a few accessible goals for myself.

General Interests
------
Outside of my research, I enjoy talking to people and getting to know different perspectives of life. I like to spend time learning other things ranging from philosophizing to learning a new skill. These days I dedicate my free time to exercising, chatting, listening to podcasts, reading, and maybe undergoing a new activity every week.
