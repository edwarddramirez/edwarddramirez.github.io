*Abstract:* We use a catalogue of stellar binaries with wide separations (up to $1 {\rm pc}$) identified by the Gaia satellite to 
constrain the presence of extended substructure within the Milky Way galaxy. Heating of the binaries through repeated encounters with 
substructure results in a characteristic distribution of binary separations, allowing constraints to be placed independent of the formation
 mechanism of wide binaries. Across a wide range of subhalo density profiles, we show that subhalos with masses $\gtrsim 65 M_{\odot}$
 and characteristic length scales similar to the separation of these wide binaries cannot make up 100% of the Galaxy's dark matter. 
 Constraints weaken for subhalos with larger length scales and are dependent on their density profiles. For such large subhalos, higher central 
 densities lead to stronger constraints. Subhalos with density profiles similar to those expected from cold dark matter must be at least $\sim 5,000$ 
 times denser than predicted by simulation to be constrained by the wide binary catalogue.
